# Netwrok-Intrusion-Detection-system
The IDS we will be developing is a network-based IDS that is programmed to detect any misuse of
the network resources (misuse detection) i.e., it detects malicious packets flowing in a network.
We will be building a classifier using Decision Trees. They help in increasing the accuracy at
which intrusions are detected. Before building the classifier, we will be required to select the most
optimal features using Feature selection. We will be employing the concept of Recursive Feature
Elimination (RFE). Because of RFE the attacks are detected more efficiently even in highly
congested networks. It also leads to a lesser number of false positives and therefore a lower rate of
false alarms. Also, The time taken to detect attacks can be cut down significantly by using
databases for storage and the concept of Dynamic multi-boosting. The proposed network intrusion
detection system can classify packets in real-time based on the packets collected from the network
flow.
